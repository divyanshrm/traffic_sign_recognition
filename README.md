# traffic_sign_recognition
My model focuses on using Neural Networks to recognize traffic signs which will be impactful on autonomous driving with 90 percent accuracy on the test dataset with a 3 layer CNN and 2 Dense layers followed by a softmax layer. 
The dataset is free and available on http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset.
